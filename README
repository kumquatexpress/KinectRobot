KinectRobot
===========

1. Install Kinect v2 SDK, downloadable from Microsoft. Currently using the public release version 2.0
2. Install the v3.2.0.0 driver from Prolific for the serial-to-usb cable. Found here http://www.miklor.com/COM/software/Win_Driver_Prolific_3.2.0.0.exe
3. To use the new prolific driver, in the device manager details for the serial-to-USB, select "Update Driver -> Browse My Computer -> Let me pick from a list" and select the driver that is not "3.4.*".
4. The robot is currently set to connect on COM port 9. If your usb isn't connected to com9, you can go to device manager -> prolific serial-to-usb -> advanced -> change com port. Also verify the bit rate is set to 57600.
5. The robot should be turned on and not plugged in before the GUI is run. It should make a sound when the GUI turns on. After the GUI starts the robot can be connected to AC power.
