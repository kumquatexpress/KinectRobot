KinectRobot
===========

1. Install Kinect v2 SDK, downloadable from Microsoft. Currently using the public release version 2.0
2. Install the v3.2.0.0 driver from Prolific for the serial-to-usb cable. Found here http://www.miklor.com/COM/software/Win_Driver_Prolific_3.2.0.0.exe
3. To use the new prolific driver, use device manager and go to the serial-to-usb, then try to update the driver and use the ones on the machine. One of these should be 3.2.0.0
4. The robot is currently set to connect on COM port 9. If your usb isn't connected to com9, you can go to device manager -> prolific serial-to-usb -> advanced -> change com port
5. The robot should be turned on before the GUI is run. It should make a sound when the GUI turns on.
